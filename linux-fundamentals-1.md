## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### 📁 Linux Directory Structure
- `/home` – user directories  
- `/etc` – configuration files  
- `/var` – logs and variable data  
- `/bin` and `/usr/bin` – essential user commands  

### 🔍 Basic Commands
| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ls`   | List files and directories |
| `cd`   | Change directory |
| `pwd`  | Show current working directory |
| `cat`  | View file contents |
| `echo` | Output text to screen or file |
| `touch` | Create an empty file |
| `mkdir` | Make a directory |

### 🧑‍💻 User Management
- `whoami` – shows the current user
- `id` – shows user UID/GID
- `adduser`, `passwd`, `usermod` – for managing users

### 📄 File Permissions
- Read `r`, Write `w`, Execute `x`
- Use `chmod`, `chown`, and `ls -l` to manage/view permissions

## 🛠️ Practical Exercises
- Navigated directories using `cd` and `ls`
- Edited files with `nano`
- Created users and changed file permissions
- Answered embedded room questions to reinforce learning

## 🗣️ Reflections
This room helped reinforce my comfort level with Linux basics and the terminal. Understanding the file structure and how to move around, create users, and set permissions is essential for real-world security tasks, especially when working with Linux-based servers or investigating systems.
