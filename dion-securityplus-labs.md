## 🔐 Security Concepts Fundamentals

### 📅 Date Completed:
April 2025

### 🧠 Objectives:
- Understand fundamental security principles such as **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** (CIA triad)
- Identify common threat actors and attack vectors
- Recognize key terms like risk, vulnerability, and exploit

### 🔍 Lab Summary:
In this lab, I explored the core building blocks of information security. Topics covered included:

- **CIA Triad**:
  - **Confidentiality**: Keeping data private (e.g., encryption)
  - **Integrity**: Ensuring data hasn’t been tampered with (e.g., hashing)
  - **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed (e.g., redundancy)

- **Security Controls**:
  - **Administrative** (e.g., policies and training)
  - **Technical** (e.g., firewalls, antivirus)
  - **Physical** (e.g., locks, surveillance)

- **Threat Actors**:
  - Script kiddies, nation-state actors, insiders, hacktivists

- **Risk Management Concepts**:
  - **Asset** + **Threat** + **Vulnerability** = **Risk**
  - Control types: Preventive, Detective, Corrective

### 🔧 Hands-On Elements:
- Matched control types to real-world scenarios
- Reviewed examples of how threats exploit vulnerabilities
- Explored risk mitigation strategies

### 🗣️ Reflections:
This lab helped solidify my understanding of what cybersecurity is *really* protecting and why layered defense matters. The content provided a strong foundation for understanding how different controls fit into the bigger picture.
