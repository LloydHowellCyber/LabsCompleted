## üîê Security Concepts Fundamentals

### üìÖ Date Completed:
April 2025

### üß† Objectives:
- Understand fundamental security principles such as **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** (CIA triad)
- Identify common threat actors and attack vectors
- Recognize key terms like risk, vulnerability, and exploit

### üîç Lab Summary:
In this lab, I explored the core building blocks of information security. Topics covered included:

- **CIA Triad**:
  - **Confidentiality**: Keeping data private (e.g., encryption)
  - **Integrity**: Ensuring data hasn‚Äôt been tampered with (e.g., hashing)
  - **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed (e.g., redundancy)

- **Security Controls**:
  - **Administrative** (e.g., policies and training)
  - **Technical** (e.g., firewalls, antivirus)
  - **Physical** (e.g., locks, surveillance)

- **Threat Actors**:
  - Script kiddies, nation-state actors, insiders, hacktivists

- **Risk Management Concepts**:
  - **Asset** + **Threat** + **Vulnerability** = **Risk**
  - Control types: Preventive, Detective, Corrective

### üîß Hands-On Elements:
- Matched control types to real-world scenarios
- Reviewed examples of how threats exploit vulnerabilities
- Explored risk mitigation strategies

### üó£Ô∏è Reflections:
This lab helped solidify my understanding of what cybersecurity is *really* protecting and why layered defense matters. The content provided a strong foundation for understanding how different controls fit into the bigger picture.

More Dion labs to come!

# üîê Cryptographic Solutions Lab ‚Äì CompTIA Security+  
> Hands-on lab from Dion Training‚Äôs Security+ course  
> Focus: Encryption, Hashing, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## üß† Overview
This lab is part of my CompTIA Security+ certification journey, using Dion Training's practical lab environment. The **Cryptographic Solutions Lab** provides hands-on experience with key cryptographic concepts, reinforcing the theoretical knowledge from the SY0-601 (or SY0-701) Security+ objectives.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Worked On
- **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption**
  - Compared AES and RSA in practical scenarios
  - Demonstrated speed vs. security trade-offs
- **Hashing Algorithms**
  - Used SHA-256 and MD5 to generate hashes
  - Observed effects of small data changes on hash output
- **Digital Signatures & Certificates**
  - Validated integrity and authenticity using public/private key pairs
  - Explored X.509 certificate structure
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**
  - Worked with a certificate authority (CA)
  - Understood the certificate issuance and trust chain
- **TLS/SSL**
  - Analyzed secure communication using Wireshark
  - Identified encryption in transit

## üß∞ Tools Used
- OpenSSL  
- Hashing utilities  
- Wireshark (for inspecting secure traffic)  
- Dion Training‚Äôs virtual lab environment

## üéØ Key Takeaways
- Symmetric encryption is fast but lacks key distribution security.
- Asymmetric encryption solves the key exchange problem but is slower.
- Hashing ensures data integrity and is fundamental to password storage and digital signatures.
- TLS/SSL plays a critical role in securing web traffic.
- PKI is the backbone of trusted communications and identity verification online.
